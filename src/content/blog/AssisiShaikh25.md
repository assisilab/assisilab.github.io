title: "Predictive Coding"
description: "Our paper on predictive coding in a model medial entorhinal cortex network is on 
[bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.11.648301). Our approach incorporates detailed neuronal properties that allows us to uncover new links between biophysics and predictive spatial coding."
