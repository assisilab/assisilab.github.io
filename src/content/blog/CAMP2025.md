title: "CAMP 2025 is Here!"
description: "We invite Ph.D. students, master’s students, final-year undergraduates, and postdocs worldwide from all backgrounds to CAMP@Pune. At this intensive 17-day course, students will be trained in theoretical and computational modeling of memory and plasticity in the brain, spanning different scales of space, time, and complexity. This year’s flavor of CAMP will be Data-Driven Neuroscience. The course will have lectures, hands-on tutorials, and projects to launch students into the exciting field of computational neuroscience. Accommodation and meals will be covered for the participants."
